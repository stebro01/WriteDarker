# Contributing to WriteDarker

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Follow these guidelines to get started.

## Branching Model

- The `main` branch contains stable code. Create new branches from `main` for each feature or bugfix.
- Use descriptive branch names, e.g. `feature/ai-endpoint` or `bugfix/login-error`.
- Submit a pull request back to `main` when your work is ready.

## Coding Standards

- Keep the codebase Pythonic and consistent with [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- Include type hints where practical.
- Add docstrings to public functions and classes.
- Before committing, run tests and linters if available.

## Issue Tracking

- Report bugs and request features using GitHub Issues.
- When sending a pull request, reference the relevant issue number if one exists.

We appreciate your contributions!
